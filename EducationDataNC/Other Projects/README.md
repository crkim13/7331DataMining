# Other Projects
This folder contains previous projects and code examples including various models for predicting graduation rates, average SAT Scores, and highly minority segregated public school campuses.   While we have included the historical machine learning datasets used in these example projects, it is highly reccommended that the school year specific datasets be used for any new projects going forward.

(i.e. Graduation Rates, SAT, ACT, End of Year (EOY), and End of Course (EOC) by grade). The following formula was applied to each cell in Excel to clean up this data for processing = TRIM(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(Sheet1!A2,"*","0"),">95","100"),"<5","0"),"<10","5"),"""",""),",",""))

The following acronyms also help to decipher field meanings: 
  * EOC - End of Course
  * EOG - End of Grade
  * CACR - College and Career Ready
